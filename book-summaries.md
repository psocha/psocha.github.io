[**_The Gig Economy_**](/book-summaries/gig-economy) by Diane Mulcahy

<small>The death of the stable corporate job? Or the beginning of a new era of customized careers and flexible lifestyles? Your choice.</small>

[**_Leonardo da Vinci_**](/book-summaries/leonardo-da-vinci) by Walter Isaacson

<small>Be curious about everything, even if it first seems useless or irrelevant.</small>

&nbsp;

[**_In Defense of Food_**](/book-summaries/in-defense-of-food) by Michael Pollan

<small>Popular nutrition is needlessly complicated and often misleading. All mainstream diet advice boils down to, "Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants."</small>
