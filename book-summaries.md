Brief summaries of non-fiction books I've read recently, mostly not tech-related.

&nbsp;

[**_How Children Succeed_**](/book-summaries/how-children-succeed) by Paul Tough

<small>Schools are preoccupied with cognitive skills. Emotional and character skills are stronger determinants of success, and better yet, they are trainable.</small>

[**_The Gig Economy_**](/book-summaries/gig-economy) by Diane Mulcahy

<small>The death of the stable corporate job? Or the beginning of a new era of customized careers and flexible lifestyles?</small>

&nbsp;

[**_Leonardo da Vinci_**](/book-summaries/leonardo-da-vinci) by Walter Isaacson

<small>Be curious about everything, even if it first seems useless or irrelevant.</small>

&nbsp;

[**_Factfulness_**](/book-summaries/factfulness) by Hans Rosling

<small>Far from being a hopeless basket-case, the "developing" world is experiencing an awakening unprecedented in human history.</small>

&nbsp;

[**_Too Much of a Good Thing_**](/book-summaries/too-much-of-a-good-thing) by Lee Goldman

<small>Evolutionary adaptations that saved our hunter-gatherer ancestors have backfired in modern times and are killing us instead.</small>

&nbsp;

[**_In Defense of Food_**](/book-summaries/in-defense-of-food) by Michael Pollan

<small>Popular nutrition is needlessly complicated and often misleading. All mainstream diet advice boils down to, "Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants."</small>

&nbsp;

[**_Peak_**](/book-summaries/peak) by Anders Ericcson and Robert Pool

<small>Want to be a world-class expert at something? Start early and make sure your training is efficient and deliberate.</small>

&nbsp;

[**_Enlightenment Now_**](/book-summaries/enlightenment-now) by Steven Pinker

<small>Thanks to the rise of science and humanism, the world is improving at a relentless pace.</small>

&nbsp;

[**_Bullshit Jobs_**](/book-summaries/bullshit-jobs) by David Graeber

<small>Many jobs are useless or inefficient, but this doesn't guarantee that economic pressures will weed them out.</small>

&nbsp;

[**_The Prince_**](/book-summaries/the-prince) by Niccolo Machiavelli

<small>Want to seize and hold onto political power? Be ruthless, occasionally be generous, and always be decisive.</small>

&nbsp;

[**_Happy City_**](/book-summaries/happy-city) by Charles Montgomery

<small>Suburban sprawl has created a world that is luxurious but miserable. How can urban planning optimize for happiness?</small>

&nbsp;

[**_Sapiens_**](/book-summaries/sapiens) by Yuval Noah Harari

<small>Civilization is both humanity's greatest triumph and its greatest mistake.</small>

&nbsp;

[**_Life 3.0_**](/book-summaries/life-3) by Max Tegmark

<small>Artificial intelligence is rapidly improving. How do we prepare for exponential economic growth, worker obsolescence, and replacement of existing political power structures?</small>
