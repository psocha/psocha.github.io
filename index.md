My name is Peter and I am a software engineer based out of the Seattle area.
I mostly do backend work nowadays, though I also have some professional experience with web and mobile development.

In my current day job, I work at Microsoft on Azure Batch, a service for running compute-intensive workloads in the cloud.
Prior to this job, I was a student at Canada's University of Waterloo, where I graduated in 2017 with a degree in software engineering.

This site is where I share projects I have worked on, solutions to interesting technical problems I have encountered, and insights I have gained about software engineering as a craft.
