For most of history, humanity was helpless.
The history of civilization is an endless list of famines, plagues, and wars, all repeatedly decimating humanity and leaving civilization stagnant for millennia at a time.
Only within the past century has humanity finally managed to reduce and contain these scourges.
Just as notable as humanity's success is humanity's change in mindset - for the first time in history, humanity believes that all problems are solvable.
When famines, plagues, and wars break out today, humanity regards them as disgraceful human failures rather than as inevitable aspects of life or as chapters of some grand divine storyline.

Whereas hunter-gatherers looked to spirits for answers and ancient civilizations looked to the gods, modern humans place their faith in humanity itself.
Humanism, the belief that humanity is the author of its story and the architect of its destiny, is now the world's dominant ideology.
Humanism's grip on humanity is so strong that it has permeated all our cultures, institutions, and thought processes.
When scholars seek answers to important questions, they conduct scientific experiments rather than consult ancient texts.
When political elites seek to legitimize their rule, they promote economic development rather than claim that they are messengers to the divine realm.
When great artists produce great art, we credit their talent and work ethic rather than divine inspiration.
When natural disaster strike some part of the world, humanity now rushes to the local peoples' aid rather than rationalize that God must have had a valid reason to smite them.
Although people continue to believe in ancient religions alongside humanism, the influence of ancient religions has been declining for many centuries.
Ancient religions today are negative reactionary forces, objecting to modernity without offering a viable alternative.

Using science and capitalism, humanism drove humanity's rapid economic development over the past few centuries.
Humanism has increased humanity's collective power while deferring uncomfortable long-term questions about humanity's final goals.
Humanism deserves credit for finally solving the problems of famines, plagues, and wars.
In return, it has created a global society that often feels mechanistic, sterile, soulless, and lacking in deeper meaning.
Humanity's modern wishes include health, happiness, and further empowerment; humanist institutions are hard at work fulfilling all these demands.

The dominant branch of humanism today is liberal humanism, which believes that individuals are equal and unique, that individual liberty should be maximized, and that individual people can be trusted to decide what is best for themselves.
Liberalism has recently emerged victorious from a bloody sectarian war against other flavors of humanism, most notably communism and fascism.
Liberalism succeeded because it was (and remains) beneficial for societies to mobilize and empower every last citizen.
At the start of the 21st century, liberal humanism stands alone, with no credible worldwide threats to its dominance.
However, like all ideologies, liberal humanism is a product of its era and it cannot be assumed to be immortal.

Several technological advancements in the 21st century will threaten liberalism as a value system.
What will become of the liberal belief in free will when mind-altering and mind-enhancement technology finally matures?
What will become of the liberal belief in human value when automation renders much of humanity economically worthless?
What will become of the liberal belief in individual choices once all-knowing algorithms have better judgment than people do?
What will become of the liberal belief in equality when socio-economic elites gain the privilege of using biotechnology to upgrade their bodies?
What will become of the liberal belief in the sanctity of human consciousness once we develop general artificial intelligence that is intelligent without being conscious?

Our 20th century institutions are still churning onwards but they are widely regarded as being outdated.
21st century governments are noticeably less visionary and ambitious than their 20th century counterparts.
Technology is advancing faster than government regulations and market forces can adapt.
Science and capitalism remain on an unstoppable and uncontrollable course, leading humanity to a destination it cannot predict or understand.

Human society is currently more individualistic and human-centered than at any previous point in history.
However, with the rise of artificial intelligence and human enhancement technologies, it is possible that humanity may become an increasingly irrelevant character even within its own story.
